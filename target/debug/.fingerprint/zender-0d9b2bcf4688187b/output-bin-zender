{"message":"`SystemTime` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`","code":{"code":"E0277","explanation":"You tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":1810,"byte_end":1811,"line_start":52,"line_end":52,"column_start":49,"column_end":50,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        println!(\"This file was created in {}\", d);","highlight_start":49,"highlight_end":50}],"label":"`SystemTime` cannot be formatted with the default formatter","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"/rustc/7737e0b5c4103216d6fd8cf941b7ab9bdbaace7c/library/std/src/macros.rs","byte_start":2926,"byte_end":2959,"line_start":99,"line_end":99,"column_start":28,"column_end":61,"is_primary":false,"text":[],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":1770,"byte_end":1812,"line_start":52,"line_end":52,"column_start":9,"column_end":51,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        println!(\"This file was created in {}\", d);","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":51}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"println!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/rustc/7737e0b5c4103216d6fd8cf941b7ab9bdbaace7c/library/std/src/macros.rs","byte_start":2818,"byte_end":2970,"line_start":96,"line_end":101,"column_start":1,"column_end":2,"is_primary":false,"text":[],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}},"macro_decl_name":"$crate::format_args_nl!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/rustc/7737e0b5c4103216d6fd8cf941b7ab9bdbaace7c/library/core/src/macros/mod.rs","byte_start":31610,"byte_end":31767,"line_start":899,"line_end":902,"column_start":5,"column_end":6,"is_primary":false,"text":[],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[{"message":"the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `SystemTime`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0277]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: `SystemTime` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:52:49\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m52\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m        println!(\"This file was created in {}\", d);\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m`SystemTime` cannot be formatted with the default formatter\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `SystemTime`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\u001b[0m\n\n"}
